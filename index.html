      Do Critical Components Smell Bad? An Empirical Study with Component-based Software Product Lines
    </h1>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p class="text-justify">This website contains complementary data
    to the <!--submitted--> paper.</p>

  <h3 id="abstract" class="page-header">Abstract</h3>
  <p class="text-justify">Component-based software product line (SPL) consists of a set of software products that share common components. For a proper SPL product composition, each component has to follow three principles: encapsulates a single feature; restricts data access; and be replaceable. However, it is known that developers usually introduce anomalous structures, i.e. code smells, along the implementation of components. These code smells might violate one or more component principles and hinder the SPL product composition. Thus, developers should identify code smells in component-based SPLs, especially those affecting highly coupled components, which are called critical components. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence of how smelly are these critical components in component-based SPLs. To address this limitation, this paper presents a survey with developers of three SPLs. We inquired these developers about their perceptions of a critical component. Then, we characterize critical components per SPL, and identify nine recurring types of code smells. Finally, we quantitatively assess the smelliness of the critical components. Our results suggest that: critical components are ten times more prone to have code smells than non-critical ones; the most frequent code smell types affecting critical components violate several component principles together; and these smell types affect the maintainability of multiple SPL components.</p>


  <h3 id="detectionstrategy" class="page-header">Detection Strategy</h3>
  <p class="text-justify">
    Coupling measures how much a SPL component provides features to other
    components, or depends on features provided by other components. That
    is, coupling metrics aim at capturing to what extent each SPL
    components is attached to the whole SPL. Thus, a high coupling for a
    given SPL component is strongly attached to others. This attachment,
    might indicate violations of the component principles, which are:
    feature encapsulation <a href="#references">[6]</a>; data access
    restriction <a href="#references">[5]</a>; and replaceability <a
          href="#references">[4]</a>. It might also suggest that the component
    realizes an essential feature to the SPL product configuration, due
    to the high number of dependencies with other components. On the
    other hand, a low coupling suggests that the SPL component is weakly
    coupled to others, which might indicate that those three component
    principles are properly followed by the component. It might also
    suggest that the component realizes a feature that is not essential
    to the SPL product configuration, due to the low number of
    dependencies among components. In order to detect critical components
    in component-based SPLs, we have applied a coupling metric-based
    strategy proposed by us <a href="#references">[7]</a>.
    This metric-based strategy combines multiples metrics to detect
    components that satisfy a property, the component criticality in our
    case.

  <p class="text-justify">Figure 1 presents the metric-based
    strategy selected for detecting critical components. We assume that
    both FANIN and CBO explicitly capture coupling between critical
    components. Based on the literature of component-based SPL, a
    critical component is the one that has too many dependencies with
    other components, which we can measure through CBO > Threshold and
    FANIN > Threshold. However, from our viewpoint, FANOUT > Threshold
    may not suffice to detect critical components. That is because,
    considering the SPL architecture, each component tends to use
    features provided by several other components. However, when a
    component is deeply located in the inheritance tree and has too many
    children components, such external dependencies indicated by FANOUT >
    Threshold may negatively impact on the SPL product configuration,
    which makes the component to become critical. Thus, FANOUT has to be
    combined with DIT > Threshold and NOC > Threshold for capturing
    critical components.</p>

    To derive thresholds that characterize critical metric values and,
    therefore, to determine threshold of each metrics, we used a
    quantile-based method from the literature <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
    It defines five value intervals, including high (values > 90%) and
    very high (values > 95%). We call <em>Critical</em> the interval
    [90%, 95%], which has the critical SPL component, and <em>Strongly
    Critical</em> the interval [95%, 100%], which has the most critical
    components. Table 2 presents the thresholds derived from the three
    SPLs selected for conducting our study. The first column groups the
    software metrics per level at the source code, namely method and
    component. The second column lists the metrics. The remaining columns
    present the four computed thresholds: 3%, 15%, 90%, and 95%. In our
    study, we have adopted Threshold = 95% for all metrics to compute
    strongly critical components, and Threshold = 90% for all metrics to
    compute critical components.

  <h3 id="smells" class="page-header">Code Smells and Violated
    Component Principles</h3>

  <p class="text-justify">
    In this work, we assess to what extent the most frequent code smell
    types affecting critical components might violate the three main
    component principles: feature encapsulation <a href="#references">[6]</a>;
    data access restriction <a href="#references">[5]</a>; and
    replaceability <a href="#references">[4]</a>. Thus, based on the most
    traditional literature about code smells <a href="#references">[8]</a>
    <a href="#references">[9]</a> <a href="#references">[10]</a> <a
          href="#references">[11]</a>, we have elicited the component
    principles that each of the nine code smell types assessed by our
    work might violate. Consider the following enumeration of these
    principles: (I) feature encapsulation; (II) data access restriction;
    and (III) replaceability.
  </p>

  <p class="text-justify">
    <b>Data Class violates:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>(I) since the smelly component implements data persistence
      that concerns other components. Both attributes and methods that
      implement data persistence for a specific component should be moved
      from the Data Class instance to that specific component. This
      operation could improve the feature encapsulation and solve the
      previous violation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-justify">
    <b>Dispersed Coupling violates:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>(I) since the smelly component implements features that
      concern multiple components scattered throughout the system. Thus,
      these features should be better encapsulated into their respective
      components.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-justify">
    <b>Feature Envy violates:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>(I) since the smelly component has features that partially
      address concerns located into other components. It suggests a poor
      feature encapsulation, which could be solved by moving the "envy"
      features from the smelly component to the most appropriate
      component.</li>
    <li>(II) since the smelly component requires accessing the data
      provided by another component. Such access has been allowed by a
      violation of the component interface, which implies a violation of
      the data access restriction principle.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-justify">
    <b>Intensive Coupling violates:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>(I) due to similar reasons when compared with Dispersed
      Coupling. The difference relies on the fact that the smelly
      component depends on a very limited set of external components,
      though such dependency is excessive. It implies a violation of the
      feature encapsulation principle.</li>
  </ul>


  <p class="text-justify">
    <b>Large Class violates:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>(I) since the smelly component realizes too many features,
      which should be distributed into multiple components instead of a
      single component. It clearly violates the feature encapsulation
      principle.</li>
    <li>(III) since the smelly component could be very difficult to
      replace with another one. That is, due to the high complexity of the
      smelly component affected by a Large Class instance, it becomes
      challenging to replace it with another component that manages all
      features provided by the original, smelly component.</li>
  </ul>


  <p class="text-justify">
    <b>Long Method violates: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>(I) since too large and complex might be realizing features
      that should be encapsulated into other external components.</li>
    <li>(III) since the smelly component possibly implements too
      complex features, which require a wide knowledge of developers about
      the method (and eventually about the whole program) to allow
      replacing the smelly method by another one with similar purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-justify">
    <b>Refused Bequest violates:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>(I) since the smelly element, refuses to either implement or
      use the features provided by the parent component. It suggests a
      need for remodularizing the involved components, in order to better
      encapsulate the features that concern each component (i.e., parent
      and children components).</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-justify">
    <b>Shotgun Surgery violates:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>(I) since the smelly component has features that imply
      changing several other components. This implication might be due to
      a poor feature encapsulation, which reflects on the source code in
      terms of unnecessary dependencies and method calls, for instance.</li>

    <li>(III) since the smelly component possibly realizes too
      complex features. That is, only a complex program logic could impact
      on the implementation of multiple components together. It suggests
      that the smelly component is difficult for developers to replace
      with another component that realizes either similar or equivalent
      features.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-justify">
    <b> Type Checking violates:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>(III) since the smelly component has a code structure that
      might be very large and complex. That is, replacing the smelly
      component with another one would require from developers a solid
      knowledge about the type checking structure.</li>
  </ul>
